ok , this is how to fix this error after installing using pip
1- download the source code
2- cd into the source code directory
pip install cffi, 
pip install setuptools,
Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required. Get it with "Microsoft C++ Build Tools": https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

3- sudo python3 compile.py (may take a while to compile) , this will create a _kem directory in ./pqcrypto/
4- go to the package directory downloaded by pip , usually in /home/$USER/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pqcrypto
5- create a init.py file in kem directory
6- remove _kem directory
7- cp _kem from compiled source code into the downloaded package by pip
